# InvenTrack — Cloud-Hosted Inventory Management & Reporting Platform

ENGTECH 4FD3 Project Design Documentation

InvenTrack is a **cloud-based inventory management system** intended to replace manual spreadsheet/informal tracking with a more consistent, centralized, and visible workflow for managing physical or digital resources (e.g., equipment, supplies, operational assets). The goal is to reduce inefficiency and inconsistencies in data entry while improving visibility and reporting.

## Project Motivation

Many organizations still track inventory manually, which often leads to:
- inconsistent data formats and duplicate entries
- limited visibility (who has what, where it is, and when it was changed)
- time-consuming reporting and auditing

InvenTrack aims to provide a structured platform to manage inventory records and generate useful reports from a single source of truth.

## Core Objectives

- Centralized inventory records stored in the cloud
- Simple, reliable **add / update / remove / search** inventory workflows
- Reporting features to support decision-making and visibility
- Clear, consistent data fields to reduce ambiguity and errors

---

## Planned Scope (High-Level)

### Inventory Management
- Create, view, edit, and delete inventory items
- Basic categorization (e.g., type, location, status)
- Track quantities and key metadata

### Reporting & Visibility
- Summary reports (counts by category/status/location)
- Exportable views for documentation/submission needs (e.g., CSV)
